An example where BM25 is better is in identifying error codes in software logs: \"Find all instances of IndexError in yesterday's logs.\" The retriever will specifically search for logs where the exact `IndexError` word (at a token level) shows up. If there was a corpus of additional troubleshooting documents and a dense retriever is used instead, this query may find items having to do with any old error, not just the `IndexError`. \n",

        "##### Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "In RAG, recall measures the ability of the retriever to find all documents relevant to the user query. Generating multiple versions of the user query creates a wider net that allows the retriever to cover more \"surface area\" and find more related documents. Sometimes a RAG system might infer a different understanding of the query and incorrectly pull out wrong documents. This reformulation ensures the broadest understanding of the query and thereby finds the broadest set of related documents, thereby increasing recall."

        "\n",
        "1. We split the full document into large \"parent\" chunks (e.g. 2000 characters).\n",
        "2. Each parent chunk is further split into smaller \"child\" chunks (e.g. 400 characters).\n",
        "3. The child chunks are stored in a VectorStore, while the parent chunks are stored in an in-memory docstore.\n",
        "4. When we query our Retriever, we do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the child chunks.\n",
        "5. Instead of returning the child chunks, we return their associated parent chunks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic idea is:\n",
        "\n",

        "- **Return** big chunks (richer surrounding context)\n",

During sleep, the body repairs tissues, consolidates memories, releases hormones that regulate growth and appetite, and performs other essential processes. Adults generally need 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night, which occurs in cycles of about 90 minutes involving REM and non-REM stages. Proper sleep hygiene—such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment—can improve sleep quality. Adequate sleep supports immune function, reduces stress, enhances mood and mental clarity, and lowers the risk of various health issues. Conversely, poor sleep can lead to fatigue, increased stress, weakened immune response, and a higher risk for chronic diseases.'"

The text in an FAQ section of a document, which are usually short and repititive, will likely not be semantically different enough. This means the FAQ section may be one single semantic chunk, which could be undesirable for token efficiency and effective context retrieval. It's also possible that since everything looks very similar, small word choices in the text may increase the \"signal to noise ratio\", thereby causing too much chunking/splitting to occur. \n",
