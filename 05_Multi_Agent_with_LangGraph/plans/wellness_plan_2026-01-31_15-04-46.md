## Exercise Plan
A well-rounded routine includes **cardio, strength, flexibility, and balance**. This plan starts beginner-friendly and progresses gradually.

### Weekly Schedule (Beginner Base: Weeks 1–4)
- **Monday:** 20-minute brisk walk + 10 minutes stretching  
- **Tuesday:** 15 minutes strength (bodyweight: squats, modified push-ups, planks, glute bridges)  
- **Wednesday:** Rest or gentle yoga (15–20 minutes)  
- **Thursday:** 20-minute brisk walk + 10 minutes stretching  
- **Friday:** 15 minutes strength (repeat Tuesday)  
- **Saturday:** 30-minute recreational activity (cycling, swimming, hike, dance class)  
- **Sunday:** Rest + 5–10 minutes easy mobility

### Progression (Weeks 5–26)
- **Cardio:** Increase to **30–45 minutes** on 3–5 days/week (mix brisk walking, cycling, incline treadmill, jogging intervals).
  - Target: **150 minutes/week** by week 8; consider **180–210 minutes/week** by months 4–6 if recovery is good.
- **Strength (2–3 days/week):** Full-body routine focusing on major muscle groups.
  - Key moves: squat/lunge pattern, hinge (deadlift variation), push, pull, core carry/anti-rotation.
  - Options: dumbbells/resistance bands/machines. Add weight or reps slowly.
- **Flexibility & balance:** **10 minutes** after workouts + **1 yoga/mobility session/week**.
- **Daily movement (“NEAT”):** Aim for **7,000–10,000 steps/day** (or add 10–20 minutes walking on busy days).

**Intensity guide:** Most cardio should feel like **“can talk but not sing”** (moderate). Add 1 shorter higher-effort interval session only after a consistent base is established.

## Nutrition Plan
Weight loss will come primarily from a **consistent calorie deficit**, supported by meal structure that keeps hunger manageable.

### Core Targets (simple and effective)
- **Protein:** Include a protein source at every meal (helps fullness and muscle retention).  
  Examples: chicken, fish, Greek yogurt, tofu/tempeh, beans + eggs, lean beef, cottage cheese.
- **Fiber:** Aim for **25–35g/day** via vegetables, fruit, oats, beans/lentils, whole grains, chia/flax.
- **Plate method (no counting required):**
  - **½ plate** non-starchy vegetables
  - **¼ plate** protein
  - **¼ plate** high-fiber carbs (brown rice, quinoa, potatoes, fruit)  
  - Add a small amount of healthy fat (olive oil, avocado, nuts)

### Weekly Meal Planning Steps (repeat each week)
1. Review your schedule and identify **2–3 busy days**
2. Choose **3–4 main dishes** that make leftovers (chili, sheet-pan chicken + veg, stir-fry, salmon bowls)
3. Plan **healthy snacks** to prevent impulse eating
4. Write a **shopping list by store section**
5. Prep basics in advance (washed greens, chopped veg, cooked grains, protein batch)

### Sample Day of Balanced Eating
- **Breakfast:** Overnight oats with berries + nuts (or add Greek yogurt for more protein)  
- **Snack:** Apple + almond butter  
- **Lunch:** Grilled chicken (or tofu) salad with mixed greens + olive oil dressing + whole grain side  
- **Snack:** Greek yogurt with honey (or cottage cheese + fruit)  
- **Dinner:** Baked salmon + roasted vegetables + quinoa  
- **Evening:** Herbal tea

### “High-impact” nutrition habits for fat loss
- **Limit liquid calories** (sugary drinks, frequent alcohol). If drinking alcohol, keep it occasional and moderate.
- **Build in 1–2 planned treats/week** (portion-controlled) to reduce all-or-nothing cycles.
- **Hydration:** Aim for **2–3 liters/day** (more if you sweat heavily).
- **Micronutrients:** Eat a variety of **colorful produce** + include sources of **calcium, iron, zinc** (leafy greens, dairy/fortified alternatives, beans, lean meats, nuts/seeds).

## Stress Management Plan
Chronic stress can increase cravings, disrupt sleep, and make consistency harder.

### Daily (10 minutes total)
- **2–5 minutes** slow breathing (e.g., inhale 4 seconds, exhale 6 seconds)
- **5 minutes** mindfulness (body scan or simple “notice thoughts, return to breath”)
- **1 small boundary:** Set a stop time for work or limit social media/news to a defined window

### Weekly
- **1 enjoyable recovery activity:** nature walk, hobby time, gentle yoga, social connection
- **Plan the week (15 minutes):** schedule workouts, grocery trip, and 2–3 easy meals

### Sleep foundations
- Aim for **7–9 hours**
- Consistent sleep/wake time most days
- Reduce screens/caffeine late day; keep bedroom cool/dark

## Weekly Check-in
Do this once per week (same day/time):
- **Body weight trend:** Weigh 3–4 mornings/week and track the **average** (better than a single weigh-in).
- **Measurements or fit:** waist or how clothes fit (every 2–4 weeks).
- **Consistency score (0–7 days):**
  - Planned workouts completed: __ / week  
  - Protein at most meals: __ / week  
  - Steps/movement goal met: __ / week  
  - Sleep 7+ hours: __ / week
- **Adjustments (only if needed for 2 straight weeks):**
  - If no progress: add **+20–30 minutes cardio/week** *or* slightly reduce portions/snacks.
  - If energy/cravings are high: increase protein/fiber, add a planned snack, prioritize sleep.

**Expected outcome:** With steady habits, you’ll average **~0.75 lb/week**, reaching **20 lb in ~6 months** while improving fitness, strength, and long-term sustainability.
