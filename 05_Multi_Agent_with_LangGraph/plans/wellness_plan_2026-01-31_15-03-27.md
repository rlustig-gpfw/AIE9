2026-01-31

## Goals
- Build consistent movement habits (cardio + strength + flexibility/balance)
- Eat balanced meals with simple planning and prep
- Reduce stress with quick daily practices and better recovery (sleep + downtime)

## Exercise Plan
**Weekly targets (beginner-friendly):**
- Aim for **150 minutes/week** of moderate cardio (walking counts)
- **Strength training 2 days/week**
- Include **flexibility and balance** most days (5–10 minutes is enough)

**Intensity guide:** Moderate = you can talk but not sing. Start easy and increase time/effort gradually.

### 7-Day Schedule
**Day 1 (Mon): Cardio + Stretch**
- 20-minute brisk walk  
- 10 minutes stretching (calves, hamstrings, hip flexors, chest, shoulders)

**Day 2 (Tue): Strength (Bodyweight)**
- 15 minutes total (1–2 rounds):
  - Squats x 8–12
  - Incline push-ups (hands on counter) x 6–10
  - Glute bridges x 10–15
  - Plank x 15–30 seconds  
- 5-minute easy walk to cool down

**Day 3 (Wed): Recovery + Gentle Mobility**
- Rest **or** 15–20 minutes gentle yoga / mobility
- Add 5 minutes balance: stand on one foot 20–30 seconds per side (repeat twice)

**Day 4 (Thu): Cardio + Stretch**
- 20-minute walk (easy-to-moderate)
- 10 minutes stretching (focus hips + upper back)

**Day 5 (Fri): Strength (Bodyweight)**
- 15 minutes total (1–2 rounds):
  - Step-ups on a stable step x 8–10/side
  - Seated or band rows x 10–12 (or “towel rows” around a sturdy post)
  - Dead bug x 6–10/side
  - Side plank (knees down if needed) x 10–20 seconds/side

**Day 6 (Sat): Fun Aerobic Activity**
- 30-minute recreational movement: cycling, swimming, hiking, dancing, or a longer walk
- Keep it enjoyable and conversational pace

**Day 7 (Sun): Rest + Light Stretch**
- 10 minutes easy stretching or a leisurely walk
- Prepare for the week ahead (see Nutrition Plan)

**Safety notes:**
- Stop if you feel sharp pain, dizziness, or unusual shortness of breath.
- If you’re new to exercise, prioritize consistency over intensity.

## Nutrition Plan
**Simple method (each meal):**
- **½ plate** vegetables or fruit  
- **¼ plate** protein (eggs, Greek yogurt, beans, chicken, tofu, fish)  
- **¼ plate** high-fiber carbs (oats, brown rice, quinoa, potatoes, whole-grain bread)  
- Add a healthy fat (olive oil, nuts, avocado)

### Weekly Meal Planning Steps (do this on Day 0 or Day 7)
1. Review your schedule and pick busy days
2. Choose **3–4 main dishes** that create leftovers
3. Plan **healthy snacks** to reduce impulse eating
4. Make a shopping list by store section
5. Prep: wash produce, batch-cook a grain, and prep 1–2 proteins

### Micronutrient focus (easy wins)
- **Color variety daily** (greens + red/orange + purple/blue) for vitamins/antioxidants  
- **Minerals**: include calcium (dairy/fortified options), iron (beans/lean meats/greens), zinc (seafood, legumes, nuts)

### 7-Day Simple Eating Structure (mix and match)
**Daily Breakfast options (pick 1):**
- Overnight oats with berries + nuts  
- Greek yogurt + fruit + granola  
- Eggs + whole-grain toast + spinach

**Daily Snack options (pick 1–2 as needed):**
- Apple + almond/peanut butter  
- Carrots/hummus  
- Handful of nuts + fruit

**Lunch options (rotate leftovers):**
- Grilled chicken or tofu salad with olive oil dressing  
- Bean-and-veggie bowl with quinoa/brown rice  
- Turkey/veggie wrap + side fruit

**Dinner options (rotate 3–4 mains):**
- Baked salmon (or tofu) + roasted vegetables + quinoa  
- Stir-fry vegetables + protein + rice  
- Chili (beans or turkey) + side salad  
- Sheet-pan chicken/veg (or chickpeas) + potatoes

**Hydration:** Aim for water regularly through the day; keep herbal tea in the evening if desired.

## Stress Management Plan
**Daily (10 minutes total):**
- **2 minutes** slow breathing (inhale 4 seconds, exhale 6 seconds)
- **5 minutes** mindfulness: notice sounds/body sensations; return attention when it wanders
- **3 minutes** light stretching or a short walk break

**Weekly habits that reduce stress:**
- **Sleep routine:** consistent wake time; wind-down for 30 minutes (dim lights, no scrolling if possible)
- **Boundary reset:** choose one small “no” this week (limit news/social media to a set window)
- **Connection:** schedule one supportive check-in (call/text) or brief social activity
- **Time management:** pick tomorrow’s top 3 tasks each evening

## Weekly Check-in
At the end of Day 7, note:
- Movement: ___/7 days completed (what felt easiest?)
- Energy levels: low / medium / high (patterns?)
- Meals: what 1–2 meals/snacks worked best?
- Stress: what helped most (breathing, walking, sleep routine)?
- One small upgrade for next week (e.g., +5 minutes walking, add one vegetable serving/day)
