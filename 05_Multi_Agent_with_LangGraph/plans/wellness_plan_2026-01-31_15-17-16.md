2026-01-31

## Goals
- Build a simple, sustainable routine that covers movement, nutrition, and stress management

- Complete **2 strength sessions/week** using bodyweight
- Eat **balanced meals** most days (protein + fiber + healthy fat)
- Practice **daily stress downshifts** (5–10 minutes)

## Exercise Plan
**How hard should it feel?** Moderate intensity = you can talk but not sing.  
**Warm-up (before every session):** 3–5 minutes easy marching in place + shoulder rolls + gentle leg swings.  
**Cool-down (after):** slow walk + stretching.

### Day 1 (Mon): Walk + Stretch

- Wall or incline push-ups — 6–10 reps  
- Glute bridges — 10–12 reps  
- Plank (knees down is fine) — 15–30 sec  
Finish with 5 minutes gentle stretching.

### Day 3 (Wed): Rest or Gentle Yoga (10–20 min)

Keep it conversational, steady, and enjoyable.

- Single-leg stand near a counter — 2 x 20–30 sec/side  
- Heel-to-toe walk — 2 passes across a room

## Nutrition Plan
### Simple daily targets (beginner-friendly)
- **Plate method (most meals):**
  - ½ plate colorful vegetables/fruits  
  - ¼ plate protein (eggs, yogurt, beans, chicken, tofu, fish)  
  - ¼ plate whole grains/starchy veg (brown rice, oats, quinoa, potatoes)  
  - Add healthy fats (olive oil, nuts, avocado)
- **Hydration:** aim for steady water intake through the day; include herbal tea if desired.
- **Micronutrients focus:** eat “a rainbow” of produce + include calcium/iron sources (leafy greens, dairy/fortified alternatives, beans, lean meats).

### Weekly meal-planning steps (do on Day 1 or Day 0)
1. Check your schedule; mark 2–3 busy days for leftovers
2. Choose **3–4 main dishes** to repeat (rotate proteins/veg)
3. Plan **2–3 healthy snacks**
4. Write a shopping list by section (produce, protein, pantry, dairy/alt)
5. Prep once: wash greens, chop veggies, cook a grain, portion snacks

## Stress Management Plan
### Daily (5–10 minutes)
- **Breathing reset (2–3 minutes):** inhale 4 seconds, exhale 6 seconds, repeat
- **Mindfulness (3–5 minutes):** sit quietly; notice sounds/body sensations; gently return attention when distracted
- **Evening wind-down (5 minutes):** dim lights, stretch calves/hips, no scrolling

### 2–3 times this week (long-term stress support)
- Limit news/social media to **one scheduled check-in** per day
- Add one enjoyable hobby block (20–30 minutes): music, reading, crafting, nature walk
- Basic time management: choose **Top 3 priorities** each morning; stop work at a set time when possible

## Weekly Check-in
At the end of Day 7, note:
- Movement: How many days did you move? Total minutes?
- Strength: Did you complete 2 sessions? Any exercises to modify?
- Energy/mood: What improved? What drained you?
- Nutrition: Did you get protein + produce most days? Any easy wins to repeat?
- Stress/sleep: What helped you unwind? What will you keep next week?

**Next-week adjustment:** keep the same plan, and increase walks by **+5 minutes** on two days *or* add a third strength round if the first week felt comfortable.
