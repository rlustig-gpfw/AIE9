## Exercise Plan
A well-rounded routine includes **cardio, strength, flexibility, and balance**. Start where you are and progress slowly to reduce injury risk.

### Weekly Schedule (Beginner → Intermediate Progression)
**Weeks 1–4 (Foundation)**
- **Mon:** 20-min brisk walk + 10 min stretching  
- **Tue:** 15–20 min strength (bodyweight: squats, push-ups (incline if needed), planks, glute bridges)  
- **Wed:** Rest or gentle yoga (15–30 min)  
- **Thu:** 20-min brisk walk + 10 min stretching  
- **Fri:** 15–20 min strength (repeat Tuesday, add lunges or rows with a band)  
- **Sat:** 30-min recreational activity (cycling, swimming, hiking)  
- **Sun:** Rest (optional easy walk)

**Weeks 5–12 (Build)**
- Increase walks to **30–40 minutes** (or add intervals: 1 min faster / 2 min easy).
- Strength moves to **25–35 minutes**, aiming for **2–3 sets** of 8–12 reps each.
- Add **5–10 minutes** of balance work 2x/week (single-leg stand, heel-to-toe walk).

**Months 4–6 (Improve & Maintain)**
- Cardio: **180–240 min/week** total (mix steady + intervals).
- Strength: **3 days/week** if recovery allows (full-body or upper/lower split).
- Flexibility: **10 minutes** after workouts + **1 longer session** weekly (20–30 min yoga/mobility).

### Strength Session Template (Full Body)
- Squat or sit-to-stand
- Hip hinge (deadlift pattern with light weights/band) or glute bridge
- Push (push-up or dumbbell press)
- Pull (band row or dumbbell row)
- Core (plank + dead bug)
Progress by adding reps, sets, resistance, or time under tension.

### Daily Movement (Highly Effective for Fat Loss)
- Aim for **7,000–10,000 steps/day** (increase by 500–1,000/day every 1–2 weeks).
- Break up sitting: **2–3 minutes of movement every hour**.

## Nutrition Plan
Goal: create a **consistent, moderate calorie deficit** while keeping protein and fiber high to support fullness and muscle retention.

### Key Targets (Simple & Effective)
- **Protein:** include a palm-sized portion at each meal (e.g., chicken, fish, eggs, tofu, Greek yogurt, beans).
- **Fiber:** aim for **25–35 g/day** (vegetables, fruit, legumes, oats, whole grains).
- **Plate method (most meals):**
  - **½ plate** non-starchy vegetables
  - **¼ plate** protein
  - **¼ plate** high-fiber carbs (brown rice, quinoa, potatoes, fruit)  
  - Add a **small portion of healthy fats** (olive oil, nuts, avocado)

### Weekly Meal Planning (to prevent impulse eating)
1. Review your week and identify busy days.
2. Choose **3–4 main dishes** that create leftovers (chili, sheet-pan chicken/veg, stir-fry, lentil curry).
3. Plan **healthy snacks** (Greek yogurt, fruit, nuts portioned, hummus + veg).
4. Make a shopping list organized by store sections.
5. Prep ahead: wash/chop vegetables, cook a protein, batch-cook a grain.

### Micronutrient Coverage
- Eat **a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables** daily (vitamins and antioxidants).
- Include mineral-rich foods: **leafy greens (magnesium), dairy/fortified alternatives (calcium), legumes/lean meats (iron, zinc)**.

### Sample Day of Balanced Eating
- **Breakfast:** Overnight oats with berries + nuts (add Greek yogurt for extra protein)
- **Snack:** Apple with almond butter
- **Lunch:** Grilled chicken (or tofu) salad with mixed greens + olive oil dressing + quinoa
- **Snack:** Greek yogurt with honey/cinnamon
- **Dinner:** Baked salmon (or beans/lentils) + roasted vegetables + brown rice
- **Evening:** Herbal tea

### Practical Guardrails (for steady loss)
- Prioritize **water** (often 2–3 L/day depending on body size/activity).
- Limit liquid calories (sugary drinks, frequent alcohol).
- Use “**planned treats**” 1–2x/week to improve adherence (portion-controlled, not untracked grazing).

## Stress Management Plan
Chronic stress can increase cravings and disrupt sleep, making fat loss harder.

### Daily (5–10 minutes)
- **Breathing reset:** 4 seconds inhale / 6 seconds exhale for 3–5 minutes.
- **Mindful pause before eating:** 30 seconds to rate hunger (0–10) and slow the first 5 bites.

### Weekly (20–60 minutes total)
- Schedule 1–2 sessions of a calming activity: nature walk, yoga, journaling, hobby time.
- Set boundaries: limit news/social media to a defined window to reduce background stress.

### Sleep Support (high impact)
- Keep a consistent sleep/wake time.
- Stop caffeine **8 hours** before bed when possible.
- Create a 20–30 minute wind-down routine (dim lights, stretch, reading).

## Weekly Check-in
Do this once weekly (same day/time):
- **Scale trend:** record weight (focus on trend, not single readings).
- **Measurements:** waist or how clothes fit (every 2–4 weeks).
- **Behavior score (0–7):**
  - Hit 150+ min cardio?  
  - Strength 2+ days?  
  - Protein at most meals?  
  - 25+ g fiber most days?  
  - Steps trending up?  
  - Sleep 7+ hours most nights?  
  - Stress practice done 3+ times?
- **Adjustments (only one at a time, for 2 weeks):**
  - If weight isn’t trending down after 2–3 weeks: add **20–30 min walking/week** *or* reduce portions slightly (especially refined carbs/fats).
  - If energy is low or workouts regress: increase sleep, add a rest day, or slightly increase calories from protein/fiber-rich foods.

This plan is designed to reliably reach **~20 lb in 6 months** through consistent habits, muscle preservation, and gradual progression.
