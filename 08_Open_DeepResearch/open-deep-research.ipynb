    "1. **User Clarification** - Optionally asks clarifying questions to understand the research scope\n",
    "2. **Research Brief Generation** - Transforms user messages into a structured research brief\n",

    "Your request was transformed into a detailed research brief that guides the supervisor's delegation strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3: Supervisor Delegation\n",
    "The supervisor analyzed the brief and decided how to break down the research:\n",
    "- Used `think_tool` to plan strategy\n",
    "- Called `ConductResearch` to delegate to researchers\n",
    "- Each delegation specified a focused research topic (e.g., sleep hygiene, circadian rhythm, blue light effects)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 4: Parallel Research\n",
    "Researchers worked on their assigned topics:\n",
    "- Each researcher used web search tools to gather information\n",
    "- Used `think_tool` to reflect after each search\n",
    "- Decided when they had enough information\n",

    "##### Answer:\n",
    "The primary benefit of parallel researchers is time reduction - research is performed faster and the overall deep reserach process completes quicker. Parallel researchers can also cover a broader spectrum of topics, helping to increase the overall robustness of the output report. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, parallel researchers adds overall system complexity, higher costs, and potentially more duplicated work. These trade-offs can be somewhat minimized, but typically the benefits outweigh these costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential researchers will typically have more efficiency and reduced costs, as the system can review and adapat the next research topics/areas before deciding on next steps. Alternatively, sequential researchers will take longer to produce the overall report since it will not cover all research directions simultaneously. Another issue is that sequentially following a single path may miss another angle that could have been explored in parallel. This is not to say that sequential researchers are always worse! Each method (parallel vs sequential) has their own specific use cases.\n",

       "# Evidence-Based Exercise Optimization for Adults Over 40: A Comprehensive Training Plan\n",
       "\n",
       "## Overview and Current Guidelines\n",
       "\n",
       "The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and World Health Organization provide clear evidence-based guidelines for adults over 40. The ACSM recommends moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for at least 150 minutes per week or vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise for 75 minutes per week, combined with muscle-strengthening activities on at least two days per week [1]. The WHO 2020 guidelines similarly recommend 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity, or 75-150 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week [2].\n",
       "\n",
       "Your current routine of 105-210 minutes of weekly cardio (daily walking plus 1-2 exercise sessions) already meets or exceeds these cardiovascular recommendations. However, research shows that going beyond the minimum 150 minutes provides additional health benefits. Each 1 MET increase in cardiorespiratory fitness confers approximately 16% decrease in mortality, with the most physically active individuals demonstrating 7-8 year gains in life expectancy [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Evidence-Based Exercise Frequency, Duration, and Intensity\n",
       "\n",
       "### Cardiovascular Training\n",
       "Research demonstrates that training intensity significantly impacts outcomes. For each 10% increase in exercise intensity (measured as percentage of peak oxygen uptake or peak heart rate), there is a substantial 1.0 ml/kg/min improvement in peak oxygen uptake [4]. Training intensity should be prescribed using 60-80% of heart rate reserve or 70-85% of maximal heart rate, with a minimum threshold of 60-70% of maximum heart rate for deconditioned individuals [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "The MET-minutes concept provides practical guidance: 500-1,000 MET-minutes per week meets minimum criteria for effective exercise dosage. Examples include 60 minutes of walking at 3 mph (3.4 METs) three days per week equals 612 MET-minutes, or 30 minutes of vigorous activity like rowing (~7 METs) three days per week equals 630 MET-minutes [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Strength Training Requirements\n",
       "The ACSM emphasizes that \"no one is ever too old to strength train\" [5]. However, only 8.7% of adults over 75 participate in muscle-strengthening activities, despite the critical importance for healthy aging [5]. Adults begin losing muscle mass at age 30, with acceleration to 10% loss after age 60 and greater than 50% loss after age 80 in sedentary individuals [6].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Strength Training Protocols for Adults Over 40\n",
       "\n",
       "### Basic ACSM Recommendations\n",
       "The foundational ACSM strength training recommendations include 8-10 exercises for major muscle groups, 1 set of each exercise, 8-12 repetitions per set, 2-3 non-consecutive training days per week, full-range movements (pain-free), and moderate speed movements (approximately 6 seconds per repetition) [7].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Advanced Evidence-Based Protocols\n",
       "The National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) recommends that healthy older adults perform resistance training 2-3 days per week with 2-3 sets per major muscle group, using 8-10 exercises including shoulder press, chest press, lat pulldowns, and leg exercises. Training intensity should progress from low (<51% 1RM) to moderate (51-69% 1RM) and potentially high (70-85% 1RM) loads [6].\n",
       "\n",
       "Research shows that older adults exhibit substantial improvements following heavy-very heavy strength training (80-84% and ≥85% of 1RM), with increases of 0.5-8.5% in maximal force per training session, resulting in an impressive average increase of 2.5% per session [8]. Despite these findings, many guidelines still recommend only moderate-intensity training, potentially limiting optimal adaptations.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Specific Loading Parameters by Goal\n",
       "For your goal of maintaining cardiovascular fitness while improving strength, the evidence supports:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Muscular Strength Development:**\n",
       "- Load: 70-85% 1RM for intermediate trainees\n",
       "- Volume: 3-6 sets of 1-12 repetitions\n",
       "- Rest periods: 2-3 minutes between exercises [7]\n",
       "\n",
       "**Muscular Power (functional improvement):**\n",
       "- Load: 40-60% 1RM \n",
       "- Volume: 1-3 sets of 3-6 repetitions\n",
       "- Rest periods: 2-3 minutes [6]\n",
       "\n",
       "## Knee-Friendly Strength Training Strategies\n",
       "\n",
       "### Exercise Selection Considerations\n",
       "Research on knee-friendly training reveals important biomechanical considerations. Deep squats and closed kinetic chain exercises requiring knee flexion over 90° increase compression between the patella and femur and should be prescribed with caution. Most open kinetic chain exercises like knee extension in the last 30° increase patellofemoral joint load and should be avoided [9].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Recommended Knee-Friendly Exercises\n",
       "Squats remain one of the best knee strengthening exercises after 40, targeting quadriceps while supporting knee flexion and improving joint stability. Start with proper form, perform 10-15 repetitions, and build strength gradually. With consistent effort, stronger knees may be noticed within 3-6 weeks [10].\n",
       "\n",
       "Additional knee-friendly exercises include:\n",
       "- Leg press (controlled range of motion)\n",
       "- Step-ups (moderate height)\n",
       "- Wall sits\n",
       "- Glute bridges\n",
       "- Lateral band walks\n",
       "- Calf raises\n",
       "\n",
       "## Weekly Routine Structure\n",
       "\n",
       "### Comprehensive Weekly Plan\n",
       "Based on the evidence, here's an optimized weekly structure that balances cardiovascular maintenance with strength gains:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Monday: Strength Training (Upper Body Focus)**\n",
       "- 5-10 minute warm-up (light rowing or walking)\n",
       "- Chest press: 3 sets x 8-12 reps\n",
       "- Lat pulldown: 3 sets x 8-12 reps\n",
       "- Shoulder press: 3 sets x 8-12 reps\n",
       "- Row variations: 3 sets x 8-12 reps\n",
       "- Core work: 2 sets\n",
       "- 5-8 minute cool-down\n",
       "\n",
       "**Tuesday: Cardio + Walking**\n",
       "- 30-45 minutes outdoor hill walking (maintain current routine)\n",
       "- Include some intervals at higher intensity (70-85% max HR)\n",
       "\n",
       "**Wednesday: Strength Training (Lower Body Focus)**\n",
       "- 5-10 minute warm-up\n",
       "- Leg press: 3 sets x 10-15 reps\n",
       "- Squats (to comfortable depth): 3 sets x 10-15 reps  \n",
       "- Glute bridges: 3 sets x 12-15 reps\n",
       "- Calf raises: 3 sets x 15-20 reps\n",
       "- Core and balance work: 10 minutes\n",
       "- Cool-down\n",
       "\n",
       "**Thursday: Rowing or HIIT**\n",
       "- Maintain current 30-minute sessions\n",
       "- Focus on 60-80% heart rate reserve intensity\n",
       "\n",
       "**Friday: Strength Training (Full Body or Functional)**\n",
       "- 5-10 minute warm-up\n",
       "- Functional movements with moderate resistance\n",
       "- Step-ups: 3 sets x 10 each leg\n",
       "- Modified deadlifts (trap bar if available): 3 sets x 8-12 reps\n",
       "- Push-up variations: 3 sets x 8-15 reps\n",
       "- Balance and mobility work\n",
       "- Cool-down\n",
       "\n",
       "**Weekend: Active Recovery + Walking**\n",
       "- Continue daily 15-30 minute walks\n",
       "- Add mobility work, stretching, or recreational activities\n",
       "\n",
       "### Session Structure\n",
       "Each exercise session should follow evidence-based structure: 10-minute warm-up (facilitating transition from rest to training and reducing cardiovascular complications), 30-60 minute conditioning phase, and 5-8 minute cool-down (preventing post-exercise hypotension and allowing gradual recovery) [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Modifications to Current Routine\n",
       "\n",
       "### Walking Enhancements\n",
       "Maintain your excellent daily walking habit while adding structured intervals. Research shows that varying intensity provides superior cardiovascular adaptations. Consider adding 2-3 minutes of brisk walking (70-80% max heart rate) followed by 2-3 minutes of recovery pace, repeated 3-4 times during your walk.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Rowing Optimization  \n",
       "Your rowing sessions are excellent for cardiovascular fitness and provide some upper body strengthening. To maximize benefits, structure rowing sessions with defined intensity zones: 60-70% max heart rate for base building, 70-80% for tempo work, and short intervals at 80-85% for peak fitness maintenance.\n",
       "\n",
       "### HIIT Class Integration\n",
       "Continue your HIIT classes but ensure they complement rather than compete with strength training. Schedule HIIT sessions at least 24 hours before or after intense strength sessions to optimize recovery and adaptation.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Recovery and Mobility Considerations\n",
       "\n",
       "### Age-Related Recovery Needs\n",
       "Adults over 40 require enhanced attention to recovery strategies. Research indicates that training repetitions to failure has not been shown to promote additional physiological adaptations in older adults and may increase injury risk [6]. Focus on progressive overload through increased load or volume rather than training to failure.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Recovery Protocols\n",
       "- Allow 48-72 hours between training the same muscle groups\n",
       "- Include active recovery days with light movement\n",
       "- Prioritize sleep (7-9 hours) for optimal adaptation\n",
       "- Consider incorporating mobility work daily for 10-15 minutes\n",
       "- Monitor subjective recovery using tools like rating of perceived exertion (RPE)\n",
       "\n",
       "### Balance Training Integration\n",
       "For adults over 40, balance training becomes increasingly important. The evidence recommends one or two sets of four to 10 different balance exercises at least 3 days per week. This can be integrated into strength training sessions or performed during active recovery periods [11].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Long-Term Health Benefits and Injury Prevention\n",
       "\n",
       "### Cardiovascular Benefits\n",
       "Maintaining and improving cardiovascular fitness provides profound long-term benefits. Research demonstrates that individuals with below-average cardiorespiratory fitness face greater cardiovascular disease risk than comparable levels of physical inactivity. The most active individuals show 7-8 year gains in life expectancy [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Strength Training Benefits\n",
       "Regular strength training after 40 provides multiple benefits:\n",
       "- Maintenance of muscle mass and bone density\n",
       "- Improved functional capacity for daily activities\n",
       "- Enhanced metabolic health\n",
       "- Reduced risk of falls and injuries\n",
       "- Better management of chronic conditions\n",
       "\n",
       "### Injury Prevention Strategies\n",
       "The research reveals important safety considerations:\n",
       "- Most exercise-related cardiovascular events (72%) occur during warm-up or cool-down phases, emphasizing the importance of proper session structure [3]\n",
       "- Progressive loading prevents overuse injuries\n",
       "- Proper exercise selection respects joint limitations (knee issues)\n",
       "- Task-specific training may provide greater functional benefits than traditional machine-based training [12]\n",
       "\n",
       "### Monitoring and Progression\n",
       "Implement a systematic approach to monitoring progress:\n",
       "- Track strength gains through load progression\n",
       "- Monitor cardiovascular fitness through heart rate recovery and perceived exertion\n",
       "- Assess functional improvements through activities of daily living\n",
       "- Regular reassessment of training loads and recovery needs\n",
       "\n",
       "The evidence strongly supports your current high level of cardiovascular fitness while highlighting the critical importance of adding systematic strength training. Your knee limitations can be successfully managed through appropriate exercise selection and progression. The proposed plan provides a evidence-based framework for optimizing health and fitness as you age, with flexibility to adjust based on individual response and preferences.\n",
