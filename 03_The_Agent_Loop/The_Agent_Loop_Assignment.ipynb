    "- Performs some operation\n",
    "- Returns an output\n",

    "results = runnable.batch([input1, input2]) # Multiple inputs\n",
    "for chunk in runnable.stream(input):       # Streaming\n",
    "    print(chunk)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)?\n",

    "\n",
    "How does **Agentic RAG** differ from traditional RAG? What are the advantages and potential disadvantages of letting the agent decide when to retrieve information?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "Agentic RAG is a step towards agency along the control-agency spectrum where the agent now determine when and how to retrieve/use the information. \n",
    "\n",
    "One big advantage is a more flexible and adaptable workflow, with the agent deciding RAG calls based on user intent. Another advantage (when using something like ReAct) is multi-step reasoning. Rather than a simple retrieve and process workflow, the agent can iteratively retrieve and process information until it reaches a level of confidence to provide an accurate response. In a way, this seems very similar to how Cursor works with our codebases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest disadvantage is false positive RAG calls, either retrieving data when it shouldn't or vice versa. This can waste money and provide wrong data to the user."

    "\n",
    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "One scenario could be legal document approvals or production code deployments. In these cases, a human in the loop hook would be necessary where the \"before model\" hook would wait for human approval/rejection and the \"after model\" hook would log and/or proceed with the delivery of legal docs or code deployment."
