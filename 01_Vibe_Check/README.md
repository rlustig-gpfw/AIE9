## 🏗️ How AIM Does Assignments

> 📅 **Assignments will always be released to students as live class begins.** We will never release assignments early.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓ **Questions** – these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!

- 🏗️ **Activities** – these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.

- 🚧 **Advanced Builds (optional)** – Take on a challenge! These builds require you to create something with minimal guidance outside of the documentation. Completing an Advanced Build earns full credit in place of doing the base assignment notebook questions/activities.

### Main Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE9 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE9/tree/main/00_Docs/Prerequisites/Initial_Setup)!


#### A Note on Vibe Checking

>"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.
>
>In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #1: General Vibe Checking Evals

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
    - Aspect Tested: Conceptual understanding and ability to explain complex technical topics using simple terms.
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
    - Aspect Tested: Text summarization and key takeaways
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested: Creative text generation while keeping content to desired length
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested: Mathematical word problem understanding and accurate translation and computation
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
    - Aspect Tested: Translation of style or tone while presevering original meaning

#### ❓Question #1:

Do the answers appear to be correct and useful?
##### ✅ Answer: The answers appeared correct and useful to the questions asked. However, they had nothing to do with the agent's main purpose of being a supportive mindfulness AI application.

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #2: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Your Assistant Can Answer)

Now test your assistant with personal questions it should be able to help with. Try prompts like:

- "Help me think through the pros and cons of [enter decision you're working on making]."
- "What are the pros and cons of [job A] versus [job B] as the next step in my career?"
- "Draft a polite follow-up [email, text message, chat message] to a [enter person details] who hasn't responded."
- "Help me plan a birthday surprise for [person]."
- "What can I cook with [enter ingredients] in fridge."

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. **Prompt: What can I cook with bacon, bell peppers, green beans, and potatoes in fridge?**
   - Result: Great combo—you can make a bunch of cozy, flavorful dishes. Here are a few easy options:

1) One-pan roasted bacon, peppers, green beans, and potatoes
- How: Heat oven to 425°F/220°C. Parboil diced potatoes 5–7 min (optional but helps crisp). Cut bacon into pieces and toss with potatoes, sliced bell peppers, and trimmed green beans in a bit of oil or bacon fat, salt, pepper, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and thyme. Roast 20–25 min, tossing once, until crisp and tender. Finish with lemon zest or a splash of vinegar.
- Add-ons: Red pepper flakes, rosemary, or a drizzle of hot honey.

2) Skillet bacon–potato hash with peppers and green beans (top with eggs)
- How: Dice potatoes small. Cook chopped bacon until crisp; remove. In bacon fat, cook potatoes with a pinch of salt, covered, stirring occasionally, 10–12 min. Add sliced peppers and chopped green beans (blanch 2–3 min first if you can); add onion/garlic if you have them. Return bacon, season with pepper, paprika, and a splash of vinegar or hot sauce. Top with fried or poached eggs and a little cheese if you like.

3) Bacon–pepper–green bean potato frittata
- How: Cook bacon, remove. In the fat, sauté thinly sliced potatoes until just tender, then add sliced peppers and chopped green beans 3–4 min. Return bacon. Pour in beaten eggs (6–8), salt, pepper. Cook until edges set, then finish under broiler or in 375°F/190°C oven until just set. Optional: cheese, parsley, or chili flakes.

4) Cozy bacon–potato chowder with green beans and peppers
- How: Crisp bacon in a pot; set aside. In bacon fat, sauté diced onion (if you have), bell pepper, and garlic. Add diced potatoes, thyme/bay, salt, pepper; cover with stock or water. Simmer until potatoes are tender. Add chopped green beans for last 5–7 min. Stir in a splash of cream or milk (or a knob of butter) and the bacon. Adjust salt; finish with cracked pepper and a squeeze of lemon.

Tips
- Render the bacon first to use the fat for extra flavor.
- Parboil potatoes or cut them small so everything finishes at the same time.
- Seasoning ideas: Italian (oregano + garlic), Cajun, or a soy–garlic splash at the end for a savory twist.

Want one of these written out with exact amounts based on how many you’re feeding and your equipment (stovetop/oven/air fryer)?

2. **Prompt: Help me think through the pros and cons of entering a wrestling tournament as an adult.**
   - Result:
   Great goal. Competing as an adult can be deeply rewarding, and it’s smart to weigh it out. Here’s a clear way to think through it, plus a simple plan if you decide to go for it.

Key questions to clarify
- What’s your recent mat time and conditioning like? (How many sessions/week can you realistically train?)
- Any current or past injuries, especially neck, shoulder, knee, back, concussions, or skin issues?
- Do you have access to a coach/team and partners near your size/skill?
- What’s your goal: experience, testing yourself, or placing?
- How much time do you have to prepare (ideally 8–12 weeks)?
- Will you cut weight or compete near your walk-around weight?
- Which rules and division? (Folkstyle/freestyle/Greco; adult/masters; novice/open)
- How will it fit with work/family and finances?

Pros
- Motivation and structure: a date on the calendar focuses training and habits.
- Fitness and skill: improved strength, conditioning, timing, and mat IQ.
- Mental growth: nerves management, resilience, problem-solving under pressure.
- Community: camaraderie and accountability with teammates.
- Feedback loop: objective measure of progress and areas to improve.
- Confidence and fulfillment: doing hard things boosts self-belief.

Cons (and how to reduce them)
- Injury risk (sprains/strains, shoulders/knees, neck, skin infections, cauliflower ear).
  - Mitigate: build strength/stability, mobility, progressive live rounds, good hygiene, headgear, mouthguard, knee pads as needed.
- Time and recovery demands.
  - Mitigate: plan training blocks, prioritize sleep/nutrition, 1–2 rest days/week.
- Weight cutting stress.
  - Mitigate: compete close to natural weight; avoid rapid dehydration; slow, small deficit only if needed.
- Cost (entry fees, membership, travel, gear).
  - Mitigate: choose local events; budget ahead; borrow gear.
- Performance anxiety/ego hits.
  - Mitigate: set process goals (e.g., hand-fight pace, first score, one clean escape); use breathwork and visualization; define success beyond win/loss.
- Logistics/rules unfamiliarity.
  - Mitigate: pick a ruleset you practice; review scoring and challenge procedures; confirm weigh-ins and bracketing.

Decision guide
- Green lights: you can train 2–3+ times/week, no major unresolved injuries, willing to compete at or near natural weight, coach/partners available, and you’re excited to learn.
- Yellow lights: minor aches, limited prep time, travel costs. Address with a realistic plan or pick a later event.
- Red lights: recent serious injury or concussion, need to cut >5% bodyweight quickly, no training partners/coaching, major work/family conflicts. Delay and prepare first.

If you decide to do it: a simple prep plan
- 8–10 weeks out: pick the event/division; get medical clearance if you have health concerns; choose weight class; set process goals. Start 2–3 mat sessions + 2 strength sessions/week (focus on posterior chain, core, neck, single-leg stability).
- 6–8 weeks: increase live goes; sharpen your A-game (one takedown, one turn, one escape/stand-up); drill hand-fighting and mat returns. Add intervals (short, hard bursts).
- 3–4 weeks: mock matches with tournament pace, referee counts, and short breaks. Dial in nutrition/hydration and skin care routine.
- 1 week: taper volume, keep intensity crisp. Review rules and scenarios (stalling, cautions, criteria). Prepare a warm-up and first-match plan.
- Day of: arrive early, hydrate, thorough warm-up, 2–3 cues max. Between matches: small carb + electrolytes, light movement. Post-event: cool-down, hygiene, debrief what worked and what to fix.

Practical tips
- Start with a local or masters/novice division to ease back in.
- Don’t chase the “perfect” weight class; performance > scale.
- Pack list: singlet/shorts as required, headgear, mouthguard, spare clothes, tape, snacks, electrolytes, towel, flip-flops, sanitizer.
- Communicate with family/work about the prep window and event day.
- Consider USA Wrestling or event insurance and confirm medical staff onsite.

Alternatives if you’re unsure now
- Do an in-house or local round-robin/scrimmage first.
- Volunteer/coach at a tournament to learn the flow.
- Try a single “test” match at an open mat or a smaller grappling event.

Mindset
- Define success as executing your plan, effort, and composure—not just the medal.
- Control the controllables: sleep, nutrition, warm-up, pace, hand-fight.
- Be kind to yourself post-competition; extract lessons within 24–48 hours and set the next step.

If you share your experience level, timeline, and any injuries, I can help you choose a division and sketch a 6–10 week plan tailored to you.

3. **Prompt: Help me plan a birthday surprise for my dad.**
   - Result:
   I’d love to help you make this special. A few quick questions so I can tailor it:
- What does your dad love (food, hobbies, music, sports, outdoors, movies, gadgets)?
- What vibe fits him: low‑key and cozy or lively with a crowd?
- Rough budget and guest count?
- Any dietary needs or mobility considerations?
- Does he enjoy surprises, or should the “surprise” be gentler (e.g., a small reveal within a plan he knows about)?

While you think on that, here are three surprise concepts you can mix and match, plus a simple timeline.

Concept A: A Day Built Around His Favorites
- Morning: Favorite breakfast (at home or café) + a handwritten “Top 10 Reasons We Love Dad” card.
- Midday activity: Pick his thing—round of golf, museum, hike, pottery class, brewery tour, movie he loves, or a home workshop project you finish together.
- Secret element: Midday “errand” turns into a surprise lunch with a few close people.
- Evening: At-home dinner with a private chef, a backyard BBQ, or his favorite takeout. Do a short toast and a 5–7 minute video montage of friends/family.

Concept B: Memory Lane Night
- Theme: “This Is Your Life.”
- Decor: Print 15–25 photos across decades; put captions with dates and small stories. Play a playlist from his era.
- Surprise: Invite 6–12 people to share a 60–90 second story. Keep it light/funny.
- Gift: A bound “Letters to Dad” book (collect notes ahead of time) or a framed photo collage.
- Dessert reveal: Custom cake with an inside joke or hobby design.

Concept C: Experience Reveal with Clues
- Create a clue trail or scavenger hunt at home leading to the reveal: tickets (game, concert, play), a weekend getaway, a class (cooking, woodworking, photography), or a day pass (spa, driving range, fishing charter).
- Include one “buddy pass” for him to bring a friend—adds excitement.
- Finish with a celebratory meal.

Budget-friendly swaps
- Potluck instead of catering; backyard instead of venue.
- DIY photo banner and paper garland; borrow string lights.
- Use a phone + free apps (CapCut, iMovie, Canva) for the video.
- Cupcakes or a Costco cake with a custom topper.

Upscale upgrades
- Private chef or catered stations (taco bar, BBQ, sushi).
- Live music (local acoustic guitarist for 1–2 hours).
- Venue with built-in ambiance (brewery room, small gallery, private dining room).

Simple timeline
- 3–4 weeks out: Pick concept, date, guest list, budget. Quietly confirm key people. Start collecting photos and 30–45 second video messages.
- 2 weeks out: Book venue/activity/chef. Order cake. Plan menu. Buy decorations/gift.
- 1 week out: Finalize schedule and roles. Edit video montage. Prepare playlist. Confirm headcount.
- 2–3 days out: Grocery/ice/serveware. Prep décor. Write your toast. Pack a “kit” (tape, scissors, lighters, knife, trash bags).
- Day of: Set up 60–90 minutes early. Sound check for video. Assign someone to greet and someone to capture photos.

Keeping it truly surprising (without stress)
- Cover story: “Casual dinner” or “quick errand” works well. If he dislikes big surprises, do the reveal early with a small group, then let the rest arrive.
- Parking: Ask guests to park a street away. One person texts you when everyone’s ready.
- Time box speeches to keep it upbeat and focused on him.

Personal touches that land well
- “Top 10 Reasons We Love Dad” read by different people.
- Coupon book: “Car wash together,” “Your playlist on our next drive,” “Homemade dinner of your choice.”
- Include grandkids’ drawings or a short skit.
- An item with meaning: engraved pocketknife, custom vinyl of his favorite songs, framed blueprint of a place he loves.

Sample secret invite text
“Shh! We’re surprising Dad for his birthday on [date/time] at [location]. Please arrive by [time] so we can surprise him at [surprise time]. Optional: send a 30–45 sec video or a short note with a favorite memory by [date] to be included in a montage. Keep it secret!”

If you share a bit about your dad’s interests, the vibe you want, and your budget, I’ll craft a detailed, step-by-step plan with a schedule, menu, décor list, and a custom reveal idea. You’ve got this—the heart you put into it is what he’ll remember most.

#### ❓Question #2:

Are the vibes of this assistant's answers aligned with your vibes? Why or why not?
##### ✅ Answer: Yes. The assistant responded with clear and practical suggestions for each prompt. It also provided alternative suggestions and tips/tricks to improve on the response. Lastly, the responses were formatted well (paragraph headings, lists, call-outs, etc).

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #3: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Requires Additional Capabilities)

Now test your assistant with questions that would require capabilities beyond basic chat, such as access to external tools, APIs, or real-time data. Try prompts like:

- "What does my schedule look like tomorrow?"
- "What time should I leave for the airport?"

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. **Prompt: What does my schedule look like tomorrow?**
   - Result:
   I don’t have access to your calendar, but I can map out tomorrow with you so it feels clear and doable.

Share these and I’ll build a tailored schedule with buffers:
- Fixed commitments (with times) and time zone
- Top 3 outcomes you want by end of day
- Wake/sleep window, commute/pickups
- Any self-care targets (workout, meals, breaks)

If you want a quick starting template, here’s a balanced outline you can adjust:
- Morning: Wake, short win (tidy/email triage), set top 3 priorities
- Focus block 1 (deep work, no meetings)
- Collaboration/meetings block
- Lunch + brief walk/stretch
- Focus block 2 (priority work)
- Admin/errands/inbox sweep
- Buffer time for spillover
- Daily shutdown (review wins, plan tomorrow)
- Movement or unwind time
- Dinner, light downtime, wind-down routine, sleep

Want me to draft a concrete timeline? Paste your appointments and preferences, and I’ll turn them into a realistic schedule.

2. **Prompt: Where is a good place to take my dog for grooming?**
   - Result:
   Great question—and a smart move for your pup’s wellbeing. I can give you specific recommendations if you share:
- Your city or ZIP
- Your dog’s breed/coat type, age, and temperament (e.g., anxious, senior)
- Budget and whether you prefer a mobile groomer or salon

Quick way to find a good groomer now:
- Search “dog grooming near me” on Google Maps; filter for 4.6+ rating with 100+ reviews; read the newest reviews.
- Check Yelp and local Facebook/Nextdoor groups; ask your vet or trainer for referrals.
- Look for certifications: NDGAA, IPG, Pet CPR/First Aid, or Fear Free.
- Consider mobile groomers for anxious or senior dogs (usually costs a bit more but less stress).

What to ask before you book:
- How long is my dog there, and is it a straight-through groom or with kenneling?
- Do you use cage dryers? Are dogs monitored the whole time?
- How do you handle anxious or senior dogs? Can we do a meet-and-greet first?
- Vaccination requirements, matting/deshedding fees, products used (hypoallergenic if needed).
- Experience with my breed/coat and photos of results.

Green flags: clean salon smell, transparent policies, written notes on your preferences, proof of training/certifications. Red flags: won’t let you tour, no vax requirements, dirty workspace, unsupervised drying.

If you send your location and a bit about your dog, I’ll shortlist a few options and help you pick the best fit.

#### ❓Question #3:

What are some limitations of your application?
##### ✅ Answer: To accurately answer these questions, the application needs to have access to my personal information, such as my personal/work calendar, my location, and dog breed. Without this context, the application cannot reliably answer or it will provide very general, high-level responses.
